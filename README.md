Eclipse
========================
A two part loader/progress bar brainstormed and developed during three hours of fun at the UsTwo Designhack. The project have gone through some small adjustments since the [first draft](https://dribbble.com/shots/1694970-Loader) with the final draft lookling like [this](https://dribbble.com/shots/1698228-Eclipse-Loader).

Live demo can be found [here](http://barbal.github.io/eclipse-ustwo-designhack)

(The demo is intended for Webkit browsers and devices.)
(Code is a bloody mess. We know.)
