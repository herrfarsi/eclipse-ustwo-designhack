Eclipse
========================
A two part loader/progress bar brainstormed and developed during three hours of fun at the UsTwo Designhack

Demo can be found [here](http://barbal.github.io/eclipse-ustwo-designhack)
(The demo is intended for Webkit browsers and devices.)
(Code is a bloody mess. We know.)

The project was a collaboration of the following people:
